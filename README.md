# mytweet_js_app

MyTweet_JS_App is a twitter like web application that lets users create tweets (max. 140 chars). 
These tweets are saved in a global timeline where any user can view. In the timeline view a user has the option to delete one tweet, 
a collection of tweets or all tweets.
Users can search for other users timelines in the search bar. The searched user's timeline will be populated with their own tweet list
An admin user has the ability to view the global timeline and timeline of individual users. The admin can delete tweets and users and 
also register new users.
